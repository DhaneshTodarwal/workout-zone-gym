# Workout Zone — Client Demo

This lightweight demo page uses your existing assets and only CSS dependencies. No JavaScript is required.

## What’s included
- Header with logo and anchor navigation
- Hero banner
- Why choose us
- Classes (3 items)
- Static gallery (6 images)
- Team (3 cards)
- Contact highlights
- Simple footer

## How to open

Option A: Double-click `client-demo.html` (should open in your default browser). Some fonts/styles may require serving over HTTP.

Option B (recommended): Serve locally to ensure all assets load correctly.

```bash
cd /home/dhanesh-todarwal/Downloads/gymlife-master
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:
- http://localhost:8000/client-demo.html

## Notes
- Branding is set to “Workout Zone”.
- You can replace `img/logo.png` with your own logo using the same filename for instant swap.
- This demo intentionally avoids carousels and popups for reliability. We can enable them after the client meeting.
